## Reflections

1. This module introduced me to the TypeScript language, why it was created, and how to use it for JavaScript development. I also learned how to set up a TypeScript development environment.
2. In this section, I learned that the static type system in TypeScript allows you to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation and allowing TypeScript to verify that your code is working correctly. In TypeScript, declarations of namespaces, classes, properties, functions, variables, and other language entities associate types with these entities. The way a type is formed and its relation to a linguistic entity depends on the type of entity. In this module, I was presented with some of the available types and shown how to associate them with variables.
3. In this module, it became clear that TypeScript can use the interface in the same way as in traditional object-oriented programming and use interfaces to define object types.
4. In this part of the course, it became clear to me how TypeScript adds some new features to standard JavaScript functions to simplify working with them.
5. Now I know that TypeScript classes extend ES6 functionality by adding TypeScript-specific features such as type annotations for class members, access modifiers, and the ability to specify required or optional parameters. It also turned out that another advantage of using TypeScript is that I can use it to develop using classes, and then, if necessary, compile them into JavaScript, which works in all major browsers and platforms.
6. This module has taught me that there are common area code templates that I can define and reuse in my codebase. They provide a way to tell functions, classes, or interfaces which type I want to use when calling them.
