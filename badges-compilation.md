# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/69981680/7END7C9Z?sharingId=7D9577235592CD33)
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/69981680/N79KNDRF?sharingId=7D9577235592CD33)
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/69981680/3XLEYMSH?sharingId=7D9577235592CD33)
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/69981680/ZPFGK342?sharingId=7D9577235592CD33)

## Reflections

1. This module introduced me to the TypeScript language, why it was created, and how to use it for JavaScript development. I also learned how to set up a TypeScript development environment.
2. In this section, I learned that the static type system in TypeScript allows you to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation and allowing TypeScript to verify that your code is working correctly. In TypeScript, declarations of namespaces, classes, properties, functions, variables, and other language entities associate types with these entities. The way a type is formed and its relation to a linguistic entity depends on the type of entity. In this module, I was presented with some of the available types and shown how to associate them with variables.
3. In this module, it became clear that TypeScript can use the interface in the same way as in traditional object-oriented programming and use interfaces to define object types.
4. In this part of the course, it became clear to me how TypeScript adds some new features to standard JavaScript functions to simplify working with them.
